## Introduction

This library is designed to provide efficient and easy-to-use data structures with a focus on flexibility and performance. By using a glue-based approach, we aim to offer data structures that are both powerful and versatile, suitable for a wide range of applications.

## Features

- **Glue Based Approach**: A unique method for implementing data structures.
- **Doubly Linked Lists**: The first data structure implemented in this library.
- **High Performance**: Optimized for speed and efficiency.
- **Easy to Use**: Simple API for quick integration into your projects.

## Installation

To use this library, you can clone the repository and compile the source code. Ensure you have `gcc` installed on your system.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bruce-mig/gl-lib.git
cd gl-lib/glthreads
make
```

## Usage

Once you have compiled the library, you can include it in your projects. Here is a basic example of how to use the glue-based doubly linked list.

## glthreads - Glue Based Doubly Linked List

### Overview

The glue-based doubly linked list is a versatile and efficient data structure that allows for easy insertion and deletion of elements from both ends of the list. It is implemented in C and provides a simple API for interacting with the list.
