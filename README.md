## Introduction

This library is designed to provide efficient and easy-to-use data structures with a focus on flexibility and performance. By using a glue-based approach, we aim to offer data structures that are both powerful and versatile, suitable for a wide range of applications.

## Features

- **Glue-Based Approach**: A unique method for implementing data structures.
- **Doubly Linked Lists**: The first data structure implemented in this library.
- **High Performance**: Optimized for speed and efficiency.
- **Easy to Use**: Simple API for quick integration into your projects.

## Installation

To use this library, clone the repository and compile the source code. Ensure you have `gcc` installed on your system.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bruce-mig/gl-lib.git
cd gl-lib/glthreads
```

## Usage

Once you have compiled the library, you can include it in your projects. Here is a basic example of how to use the glue-based doubly linked list.

## Running the Driver Program

To test the library, you can run the provided driver program (`main.c`) using the `Makefile`. Follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `glthreads` directory:
   ```bash
   cd gl-lib/glthreads
   ```

2. Compile the program using `make`:
   ```bash
   make exe
   ```

3. Run the executable:
   ```bash
   ./exe
   ```

This will execute the driver program and demonstrate the functionality of the glue-based doubly linked list.
